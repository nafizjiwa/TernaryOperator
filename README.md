# TernaryOperator
What is a Ternary Operator?
It is a simplified CONDITIONAL operator an alternative to an if...else statement.
The only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: 
  a condition followed by a question mark (?),
  then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), and
  finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy.<br>
